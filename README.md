##Description

During this pandemic, it’s impossible to conduct face-face communication
to the students to enhance their speaking skills. To make it possible, we
need a virtual meet platform in which people can communicate with each
other and share their knowledge to get ready for the jobs. Communo which
is web application, that will generate virtual meets through google meet
application. In general, People who are going to communicate in the google
meet should know the meeting credentials like Meet link, time and
password etc before the meet has started. We design a web application
consisting of a bunch of desks where the users in one desk can’t access
the other desk and the people in each desk can communicate with each
other. This platform will enable people from an organization to share their
ideas and enhance their communication skills, without being worried about
the meeting credentials. Our goal is to conduct virtual group discussions
(GD), debates and jam sessions to enhance our students’ skills by
providing a flexible platform.
